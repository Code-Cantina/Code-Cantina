# Danny Copeland
I'm Danny, a software developer with a focus on iOS development. I recently released my first personal app to the Apple store, [Wacky Casino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wacky-casino/id1556778552).
I am now working on scoping and mocking out a NHL pick-um style application. Always learning.
