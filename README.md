I'm a software developer with a focus on iOS development. I recently released my first self-published app, [Wacky Casino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wacky-casino/id1556778552) to the Apple store, a fun and quirky mix of casual games with a casino atmosphere.

At my day job I am lucky enough to work on every aspect of 2 full feature commercial ecommerce applications live in the Apple App Store. I have been very fortunate to have exposure to all aspects of the software development life cycle. I have worked on a multitude of Apple and 3rd party SDKs, but I know I have even more yet to learn. 

In my spare time I am working on scoping / mocking out an NHL pick-um style application, revamping my website with Aurelia, and playing with multiple other side projects and Apple frameworks.

My most recent years of experience have all been in the Apple ecosystem, but my programming roots began in .Net land.

Always learning. Some of my favorite learning resources:
* [Stanford iOS Courses](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpGHT1n4-mAsxuRxVPv7kj4-dQYoC3VVu)
