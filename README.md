# Hi, I'm Danny ðŸŒŠ

![minime](githubbanner.png)

I'm a software developer with a focus on iOS development. I recently released [Wacky Casino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wacky-casino/id1556778552) to the Apple store, a fun and quirky mix of casual games with a casino atmosphere.
I am now working on scoping and mocking out a NHL pick-um style application. 

Always learning.
