I'm a software developer with a focus on iOS development. I recently released my first self published app, [Wacky Casino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wacky-casino/id1556778552) to the Apple store, a fun and quirky mix of casual games with a casino atmosphere.

My day job I am lucky enough to work on every aspect of 2 full feature commercial ecommerce applications live in the Apple App Store.

In my spare time I am working on scoping and mocking out an NHL pick-um style application, revamping my website and playing with multiple other side projects and Apple frameworks. 

I have been very fortunate to have exposure to all aspects of the software development life cycle. I have worked on a multitude of Apple and 3rd party SDKs, but I know I have even more yet to learn. I remember the old provisioning profile nightmares and am no stranger to vague Apple review kickbacks, but even with the woes I wouldn't trade it for anything. I am excited for what the future brings. 

My most recent years of experience have all been in the Apple ecosystem, but my programing roots began in .Net land.
