I'm a software developer with a focus on iOS development. I recently released [Wacky Casino](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wacky-casino/id1556778552) to the Apple store, a fun and quirky mix of casual games with a casino atmosphere.
I am now working on scoping and mocking out a NHL pick-um style application, revamping my website and playing with multiple other side projects and Apple frameworks. 

Always learning.

I have been very fortunate to have exposure to all aspects of the software development life cycle. I have worked on a multitude of Apple and 3rd party SDKs, but I know I have even more yet to learn. I remember the old provisioning profile nightmares and am no stranger to vague Apple review kick backs, but even with the woes I wouldn't trade it for anything. I am excitted for what the future brings.
